      <p>This project was made to simulate an app.</p>
      <p>Crash was made mostly to serve the people, who party late into the night away from home. Originally most of the app was red, this was meant to be a signal to how quick it was suppose to go. However feedback came in, that mayhaps it was a tad bit too much. In fact it was so much, that it played on the danger sense of the red colour instead. To subjigate a bit of this response, most of the pages are now orange. As the orange colour keep the energy from red, but also has a lesser danger effect. The red colour was preserved on the buttons to pry attention towards them. Lastly, it was deemed hard to navigate the app, so a dropdown menu was added to mitigate that.</p>
