	  <div class="bodytext"><h1>Legacy Crash</h1><p>Crash was made mostly to serve the people, who party late into the night away from home. These people can not always reliably get home or they may just need a quick place to sleep. Crash was made to circumvent this, by offering a solution of very temporary places of residence. A simple allegory, crash is to the hotel business, what uber was to taxis.</p><p>The red colour that permeate the app was meant to carry energy through the pages. However it activated the danger sense more than often than not and was a mess to navigate in.</p><a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/cbaab381-1ff2-4d72-66b8-5ccfd3d6ff50-bd9b/"><p>Click here to visit the page</p></a></div>
