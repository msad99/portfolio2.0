      <h1>Bridge Project</h1>
      <p>The very first project</p>
      <p>Previously, we had wandered Copenhagen and been told to take pictures of bridges. These pictures, where then to be used in a freeform project, which was to be done in photoshop. I wanted to create an image, that was different, yet mostly used simple techniques. I did this by creating this image, where the viewer could decide. Was the colour being taken away or was it being added to the picture. To emphasise this i added the car, which is in the middle of the rainbow divider.</p>
